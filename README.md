BUGS:

-when going back to the edit alert page you can't actually edit (have to click "done" and then "edit" again). Fix by either defaulting to done or allowing edit.

-Text goes past the label when editing and there are a lot of days.

-If no dosage specified, don't show the label on the home screen

-If just 1 time a day, have label say "1 time" not "1 times"

-Adding the next alarm in a week from now for some times that shouldn't be added that much.
